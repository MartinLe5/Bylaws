\item The Society supports the right to a leave of absence for its members. Whereas the Society recognizes that departments may have different expectations of graduate students, the terms for leaves of absence are determined by each department separately.
\item The Society supports international students at Western and advocates for fair and regulated international student fees. The Society will lobby and pressure the University to freeze international student tuition fees.
\item The Society supports the right to appeal. In any academic appeal, a graduate student may use the support of students, faculty members, and/or family members.
