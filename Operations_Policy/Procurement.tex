\item \textbf{Requisitioner}: The Society of Graduate Students.

\item \textbf{Requisitioning Committee:} The committee which prepares a procurement process and reviews bidder submissions as appropriate. Certain contracts (outlined below) require a particular SOGS Committee to serve as the requisitioning
	committee.
\end{longenum}

\item \textbf{Scope} \newline
This policy applies to the purchase of:
\begin{longenum} [label*=\arabic*., align=left]

	\item The extension or renewal of any exciting contracts for goods as described above unless explicitly excluded in this policy.
	
	\item Existing Contracts: \newline

	Goods and services valued up to and including \$5,000 not addressed by the inclusion rules above.

	\item Wherever possible efforts should be made to seek at least one bid from a non-profit, not-for-profit or cooperative vendor;
	\item Price quotations must be obtained using the method appropriate to the complexity and estimated cost of the good or service under consideration as described below.

\item \textbf{Sole Source}
